# Redesigning the Renewals

Every five years, Ontarians must renew their driver’s licence and health card to maintain their benefits.

Ontario’s online renewal platforms were meant to provide an efficient alternative to the in-person process. Instead, the service’s incoherence and exclusion of those who do not have a driver's licence left thousands of users frustrated and confused.<br/>

I was part of an ambitious project to redesign Ontario’s renewal experience for its over 5 million annual users.­­­

# Project Info

<Note>

<Accordion title={"What did our weekly sprints entail?"} left={true}>

Mondays were focused on user research, Tuesdays and Wednesdays on prototyping, Thursdays on user testing, and Fridays on presenting our findings.

To ensure thorough and clear communication, every day began with a stand-up and ended with a check-in.

# Defining Key Pain Points

During our team's initial meetings with the current stakeholders of the renewal platforms, we were informed that on each of the platforms, there was a Rate Our Service form that users could fill and submit.

Seeing that analyzing this direct and honest feedback would be one of the best ways for our team could begin to empathize with the frustrations of these users, our team seized this opportunity and efficiently categorized over **1,593 submissions** based on topic and frequency.

Our team then identified the most prominent complaints and focused our future redesign efforts on amending these pain points.

| Gather data | Analyze feedback           | Identify pain points |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
|             | 1,593 feedback submissions | 3 pain points        |

# Turning Suffering Into Solutions

From our discussions with subject matter experts and analysis of raw user feedback, our team diagnosed three major issues with the current service:

<FullBleed>
  <PainPoints
    data={[
      {
        image: 'test.png',
        title: 'Difficult to find the appropriate service',
        quotes: [
          "The system only works if you are renewing both [of your cards] at the same time. This means I have to go to a ServiceOntario centre for my health card just because I do not drive. **I'm very disappointed.**",
          "If you did not click the correct link at first, it was **very difficult** to find the option to renew just your driver's licence and not your health card.",
        ],
        result:
          'Combine the standalone and integrated services into a universal renewal service',
      },
      {
        image: 'test.png',
        title: 'Can’t understand why they cannot complete the process',
        quotes: [
          "After I entered my driver's licence information, I was told I was ineligible **without indication of the reason.** If I am considered ineligible to renew online, please **tell me why.**",
          "My renewal was denied and I was **not given any reason** besides 'you're not eligible'. I think the government owes **more explanation** when it denies a service to a citizen.",
        ],
        result:
          'Explain the reason of all errors and clearly outline next steps',
      },
      {
        image: 'test.png',
        title: 'Redundant and convoluted text and questions',
        quotes: [
          'Had to enter **my name thrice and address at twice** after I had already selected that there have been no changes. **Very annoying!**',
          "**It wasn't clear** on the site when I need to get a new photo in-person. A line of added text on this topic in the instructions would be useful.",
        ],
        result:
          'Reduce the repetitive input of information and simplify language',
      },

# Defining the Challenge

Considering how one of our product owner's primary concerns when approaching this project was that our redesign's scope would be too large, our team approached our problem definition with a divergent and convergent thinking process.

## How Might We's

From our initial research, my fellow product designer and I ideated a diverse set of solutions to users' current problems.

<FullBleed>
{/* <MiroEmbed title={"Miro board showing our ideation of a diverse set of solutions to users' current problems."} board_src={"https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kuecCiE=/"}/> */}
</FullBleed>

Whether it was further improving the effectiveness of help modals, reassuring the user of the information they input, or optimizing the Ontario.ca topic page's representation of renewal services, this divergence in our brainstorming then allowed us to converge upon a single problem statement:

<HighlightedSection>

  ## Problem Statement

  We have observed that the ServiceOntario online renewal flows are **not meeting user needs**, which is causing low completion rates, negative user feedback, inclusion concerns, and low uptake on digital services.

  How might we design a **one-window digital renewal transaction flow** that promotes usability and inclusion by reducing time on task and increasing positive feedback on eligibility?

</HighlightedSection>

# Starting With the Best Case Scenario

Especially with a renewal service, there is certainly no lack in the number of paths, exceptions, and errors that a user can take to encounter along their journey.

Thus, we first highlighted the requirements that a user would need to meet to successfully renew their driver's licence or health card.

<TrelloEmbed title={"Trello board showing the requirements that a user would need to meet to successfully renew their driver's licence or health card."} src={"https://trello.com/b/hJOm6Iwx"}/>

Then, to emphasize an easy and effortless central flow in our redesign, we identified the key set of steps that a user would take to successfully renew their driver's licence or health card.
