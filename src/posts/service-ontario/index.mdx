# Redesigning the Renewals

Every five years, Ontarians must renew their driver’s licence and health card to maintain their benefits.

Ontario’s online renewal platforms were meant to provide an efficient alternative to the in-person process. Instead, the service’s incoherence and exclusion of those who do not have a driver's licence left thousands of users frustrated and confused.<br/>

I was part of an ambitious project to redesign Ontario’s renewal experience for its over 5 million annual users.­­­

# Project Info

As a product designer, I worked in a small but effective team of five: our lab leader Xiaopu Fung, lead designer Sukhi Chuhan, fellow product designer Emily Louie, and prototype developers Muiz Sohani and Niya Xu.

Within the Kitchener-Waterloo lab of the Ontario Digital Service, we conducted most of our projects in a series of 4-6 adapted Google sprints.

Mondays were focused on user research, Tuesdays and Wednesdays on prototyping, Thursdays on user testing, and Fridays on presenting our findings. To ensure thorough and clear communication, every day began with a stand-up and ended with a check-in.
