# Redesigning the Renewals

Every five years, Ontarians must renew their driver’s licence and health card to maintain their benefits.
Ontario’s online renewal platforms were meant to provide an efficient alternative to the in-person process. Instead, the service’s incoherence and exclusion of those who do not have a driver's licence left thousands of users frustrated and confused.
I was part of an ambitious project to redesign Ontario’s renewal experience for its over 5 million annual users.­­­
