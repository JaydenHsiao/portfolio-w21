In my first hackathon, I partnered with two of my classmates to streamline the
boba purchasing experience and inspire a stronger community of boba lovers. In
twenty-four hours, I interviewed hackathon participants, conducted competitive
analysis of popular applications, created a medium-fidelity prototype in Figma,
and exhibited our solution to a panel of judges in an **award-winning** pitch.

# Research

## Step 1: Understanding the Perception of Boba

Due to the limited timeline of this project, we decided to limit our target
demographic to young adults. Thus, to discover how other customers interact with
their boba, we sent out a Google Forms survey and gathered over **184
responses** from other StarterHacks participants, classmates, and friends.
